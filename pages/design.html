			<h3 class="h3-subtitle-first bold">Project Description</h3>
			<p>We proposed a system which is complete package and will solve all the problems of
providing quick emergency assistance. The proposed system was widely accepted by the
faculty members and approved.
Figure</p>
			<p>Our system has a Quadcopter with a gyro control chip which controls the basic
maneuvers for the UAV and we propose to build a custom designed chip to decode
the signals coming from the on-board android smartphone and send commands to the
controller chip. We used a android smartphone to provide the quadcopter with GPS,
Camera, and 4G internet connection. So this quadcopter is now capable of performing completely unmanned 
ight and be controlled using http requests coming to it through
4G connection. The quadcopter also provides a http feedback to the computer about
its GPS position. The GPS can also be used to make a 
ight plan for the quadcopter.
The on-board mobile also provides a UDP live stream of the camera vision and can be
controlled using.</p>

			<p>Lets take a typical emergency assistance scenario and apply our proposed solution
to it. A call comes to the police about a car accident that has happened on a highway
in Abu Dhabi. This is emergency case it might take several hours for the police to
arrive and analyze the situation. The police places a pin on the map in the quadcopter
software in computer. The computer sends the http request to the quadcopter to move
to that specic location. The quadcopter immediately starts up and goes to the GPS
location. This is done with a feedback loop which calculates the current GPS location
and the required GPS location. While all of this is done, the policeman can see the
current location of the quadcopter on the map. When the quadcopter reaches the end of
its destination, the policeman turns on the gesture control mode and starts controlling
the movement of the quadcopter precisely using hand. Now the policeman can access
the situation and can also possibly drop the rst aid kit if the situation is too serious.</p>

			<h3 class="h3-subtitle bold">Using a UAV for agility and accessibility</h3>
			<p>Unmanned Air Vehicles are light, fast and can be designed to carry the essential
aid equipment. Along with that unmanned vehicles can be used to perform critical
operations in areas where human life cannot be risked. Furthermore, quick response
to a distress call can dierentiate between life and death of a person. Therefore, air
emergency medical assistance is needed very quickly in some cases and the delay cased
by set-up and start of manned vehicles cannot be aorded at this point.</p>
			
			<h3 class="h3-subtitle bold">Use of a quadcopter for ease of control and high payload delivery</h3>
			<p>With the use of four propellers pushing the air downwards with immense speed, a
typical quadcopter is capable of lifting high payloads. UAVs for search and rescue oper-
ations are required to be small and at the same time carry high payloads. Quadcopter
is perfect for such kinds of ease of control applications because of its usage of four high
rpm brushless motor run propellers. These brushless motor speeds can be intelligently
varied to provide 6 degrees of freedom by sensing the gyroscopic values of Pitch, Yaw,
and roll which.</p>

			<p>The quadcopter can be controlled using two types of congurations, one is the X
conguration and the other is the + conguration. For a very stable 
ight and camera
view being not blocked, we propose to use a X conguration quadcopter.
Figure 2.2: X conguration for-
ward motion</p>

		<p><p class="label label-success">Forward Direction:</p> By speeding up the back motors, a forward direction motion
can be accomplished. This makes the thrust of the motors at an angle to the z-axis.
The thrust has force components in the weight direction to balance or cancel the weight
and a unbalanced forward component to make the quadcopter go forward.</p>

		<p><p class="label label-success">Left Direction: </p> By speeding up the right motors, a left direction motion can be
accomplished. The thrust has force components in the weight direction to balance or
cancel the weight and a unbalanced forward component to make the quadcopter go left.</p>

		<p><p class="label label-success">Right Direction:</p> By speeding up the left motors, a right direction motion can be
accomplished. The thrust has force components in the weight direction to balance or
cancel the weight and a unbalanced forward component to make the quadcopter go right.</p>

		<p><p class="label label-success">Backward Direction: </p>By speeding up the front motors, a backward direction motion
can be accomplished. This makes the thrust of the motors at an angle to the z-axis.
The thrust has force components in the weight direction to balance or cancel the weight
and a unbalanced backward component to make the quadcopter go forward.</p>

		<h3 class="h3-subtitle bold">Global control by using on-board 4G smartphone</h3>
		<p>Usually quadcopters have a limited range radio link but emergency assistance should
not have limited range of control. It was decided to use 4G network for control and
communication with the quadcopter as 4G network is accessible from within 35Km range
of a cellular tower. Furthermore, a typical city is divided into cells and at almost each
node a telecommunication tower is located. This is a huge advantage for our quadcopter
since it can have a connection to base control all around the city where the 3G radiation
pattern is in range. A smartphone will be mounted on the quadcopter for providing
a 4G internet connection. The internet connection on the quadcopter can be used for
several things such as providing the GPS location, video stream, and controlling the
quadcopter maneuvers.</p>

		<h3 class="h3-subtitle bold">Live streaming video vision by using UDP</h3>
		<p>Video streaming of quadcopter's vision is possible by using the on-board android
smartphone. An app it to be designed in such a way that it streams video back to the base station by use of UDP. This is possible through 4G connectivity since use of WiFi
for such long range is not advisable.</p>
		<p>A video stream is acceptable if there is any fault of packages lost in the way. It
is because if during the video streaming the packages get lost due to the router being
overloaded for instance then the video streaming can still be resumed with a reduced
quality.</p>
		<p>The TCP/IP protocol would force the video stream to wait until the dropped packages
are found to resume processing newer packages. The point that is usually misunderstood
is that when few packages are lost it doesn't mean a whole frame is lost but rather few
pixels from a certain frame are lost and hence waiting for these lost pixels to come back
is a waste since the video stream has already moved on to new frames. However TCP
could have been a good option if the case was about recorded video streaming since
when a package is lost the system pauses the frame until the all the data for the next
frame has been collected in the buer giving the term `buering'.</p>
		<p>Therefore, we decided to use UDP for our live video streaming.</p>
		
		<!-- Smartphone to Controller Board USB Connection  -->
		
		<h3 class="h3-subtitle bold">Smartphone to Controller Board USB Connection</h3>
		<p>The receiver in our schematics is going to be a smartphone which will be using 4G
internet to receive the data. The smartphone onboard the quadcopter will act as client
while the PC with the user will act as the server to send the controls. The data will
then be passed to an Atmega328 chip using USB-Serial FTDI chip that will in turn send
the 
ight data to controller board. The application will send byte array through serial
to Atmega328 Chip that will contain the 
ight values such as aileron value to control
the roll, elevation value to control the elevation angle with horizontal, rudder value to
control the yaw movement, and thrust value to control lift force.</p>

		<!-- Hand-Gesture Models -->
		<h3 class="h3-subtitle bold">Hand Gesture Models</h3>
		<p>In order to control the quad-copter using a leap motion device, a model of the hand
gestures should be made in order to approximate the nger positions in three dimensional
space.</p>
		<p>Leap Motion provides a library to use for creating hand objects and approximates
the nger positions in the 3 dimensional space. According to these positions of the
ngers, we can code the Leap Motion to generate http requests to the android on the
quad-copter through internet.</p>
		<p>We will program a java application to detect the hand gestures and then according
to the gesture input, a particular http request will be made to the android. Eclipse
IDE will be used to program the desktop application which will provide the internet
connection to the quad-copter.</p>

		<!-- Kalman Filter -->
		<h3 class="h3-subtitle bold">Kalman Filter</h3>
		<p>There is a module in the controller board that processes the huge amount of samples
the microprocessors take from the sensors. To put that into perspective let's say one have
a micro-controller that has a clock speed of 15 MHz, that means the micro-controller
will be taking 15 million samples from the sensor every second. All this amount of data
is meaningless if the right data is not processed from this, Kalman Filter is a sequence of
steps that will initially remove the sampled data that are purely noise and then average
out the important data to pick the most appropriate one for input.</p>
		<p>The leap motion captures about 200 frames per second or more depending upon the
computer processing power. This is huge data speed and sudden errors can cause the
system to In our project, we will implement a Kalman Filter on the hand gesture data.</p>
